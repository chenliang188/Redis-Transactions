A simple 2-tier architecture -- a web application running on top of an in-memory database.

## Components

The major components of dashboard include:

1. A Redis in-memory database that is set up as an ElastiCache service.
2. A Quartz-driven worker that periodically scans the logs in S3, computes the various
metrics, and updates the Redis cache.
3. A Play web app that receives queries and returns the cached metrics data. It interprets and executes the queries over the Redis cache and assembles the metrics suitable for presentation.
4. A client-side JavaScript framework like D3 that renders the charts.

## Stack Setup & Deployment

It will be a distinct app outside Synapse. It can run locally from within Fred Hutch or in AWS. If it runs in AWS, it can run on a spot instance without load balancing (Elastic Beanstalk not needed). As this app does not
persist data, it should be trivial to roll back or even re-initialize from scratch. If any deployment process is needed, it would be a throw-away dev stack. The dev stack will be launched for smoke testing. Once testing passes, it can become the prod stack by updating the DNS in Route53. The retired prod stack can be then terminated.

## Security

Plan to use Google OpenID to limit the access to @sagebase accounts.
