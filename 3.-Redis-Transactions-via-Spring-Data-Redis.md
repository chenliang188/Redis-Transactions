### Optimistic locking using `GETSET`

One particular problem is to use a Redis key to track the maximum. When setting the maximum, operations get-compare-set needs to be synchronized. On Redis, a cheap way to achieve the correct result is to use Redis's `GETSET`. According to Redis documentation, `GETSET` "atomically sets key to value and returns the old value stored at key."  The approach is to `GETSET` with the new max and make sure the returned max is not larger; otherwise throw an exception. Since we are optimistic that race conditions like this rarely occur, instead of throwing an exception right away, we retry a couple times. The assumption is that, if we retry a limited number of times, the correct results will highly likely go through (speaking of being optimistic).

    long curMax = valueOps.get(maxKey);
    int retries = 0;
    final retryLimit = 5;
    while (curMax < newMax && retries < retryLimit) {
        curMax = newMax;
        newMax = valueOps.getAndSet('max', curMax);
        retries = retries + 1;
    }
    if (curMax < newMax) {
        throw new RuntimeException("Updating max " + newMax
                + " for key " + maxKey + " failed.");
    }

### Optimistic locking using `WATCH`, `MULTI`, and `EXEC`

If the transaction is beyond a simple `GETSET`, Redis does support transactions with `WATCH`, `MULTI`, and `EXEC`.  They draw a transaction boundary within which multiple commands are bundled together such that no other commands will be executed in between.  The simplest pattern would be:

    WATCH
    // Reads
    // UNWATCH if updates are already done
    MULTI
    // Writes
    EXEC

There is a twist to use these commands in the context of Spring Data Redis.  According to the documentation, "These operations are available on RedisTemplate, however RedisTemplate is not guaranteed to execute all operations in the transaction using the same connection." and "Spring Data Redis provides the SessionCallback interface for use when multiple operations need to be performed with the same connection, as when using Redis transactions."  That said, the Redis commands for transactions need to execute within an anonymous class of SessionCallback.

    SessionCallback<String> callback = new SessionCallback<String>() {
        @Override
        public <K, V> String execute(RedisOperations<K, V> operations) throws DataAccessException {
            operations.watch();
            // Reads and unwatch() if needed
            operations.multi();
            // Writes
            operations.exec();
        }
    };

    redisTemplate.execute(callback);

Note, being consistent with Redis' `exec()` command, `RedisOperations.exec()` returns `null` results when the execution is aborted due to watch violations.

Remember we are still doing optimistic locking here.  So, to make it truly ready for production work, wrap the above code into a retry loop with exponential backoffs:

    SessionCallback<String> callback = new SessionCallback<String>() {
        @Override
        public <K, V> String execute(RedisOperations<K, V> operations) throws DataAccessException {
            int retryLimit = 10;
            long delay = 10;
            List<Object> results = null;
            int i = 0;
            while (results == null && i < retryLimit) {
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(delay << i);
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    new RuntimeException(e);
                }
                operations.watch();
                // Reads and unwatch() if needed
                operations.multi();
                // Writes
                results = operations.exec();
                i++;
            }
        }
    };

    redisTemplate.execute(callback);

### Distributed locks

Optimistic locking with retry is simple to implement and works well when race conditions rarely occur. However, the solution runs into problems when the load increases and the chance of race conditions increases with the load.  This is where distributed locks come to rescue. With Redis it is easy to implement distributed locks.
