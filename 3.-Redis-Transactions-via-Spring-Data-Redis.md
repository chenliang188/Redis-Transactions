### Optimistic locking using `GETSET`

One particular problem is to use a Redis key to track the maximum. When setting the maximum, operations get-compare-set needs to be synchronized. On Redis, a cheap way to achieve the correct result is to use Redis's `GETSET`. According to Redis documentation, `GETSET` "atomically sets key to value and returns the old value stored at key."  The approach is to `GETSET` with the new max and make sure the returned max is not larger; otherwise throw an exception. Since we are optimistic that race conditions like this rarely occur, instead of throwing an exception right away, we retry a couple times. The assumption is that, if we retry a limited number of times, the correct results will highly likely go through (speaking of being optimistic).

```java

    /**
     * Checks if the new value is greater than the current max. If so,
     * sets the max to the new value.
     */
    void setMax(final long newVal) {
        long maxInRedis = valueOps.get(maxKey);
        long maxAtHand = newVal;
        int retryCount = 0;
        final int retryLimit = 5;
        while (maxAtHand > maxInRedis && retryCount < retryLimit) {
            maxInRedis = maxAtHand;
            maxAtHand = valueOps.getAndSet(maxKey, maxAtHand);
            retryCount++;
        }
        if (maxAtHand > maxInRedis) {
            throw new RuntimeException("Updating max with for key "
                    + maxKey + " failed.");
        }
    }

```

### Optimistic locking using `WATCH`, `MULTI`, and `EXEC`

If the transaction is beyond a simple `GETSET`, Redis does support transactions with `WATCH`, `MULTI`, and `EXEC`.  Together they draw a transaction boundary within which multiple commands are bundled together such that no other commands will be executed in between.  The simplest pattern would be:

    WATCH
    // Read
    // May UNWATCH if updates are already done
    MULTI
    // Write
    EXEC

There is a twist to use these commands in the context of Spring Data Redis.  According to the Spring documentation, "These operations are available on RedisTemplate, however RedisTemplate is not guaranteed to execute all operations in the transaction using the same connection."  Instead of executing watch(), multi(), and exec() directly on RedisTemplate, the correct procedure is as follows, "Spring Data Redis provides the SessionCallback interface for use when multiple operations need to be performed with the same connection, as when using Redis transactions."  That said, the Redis commands for transactions need to execute within an instance of SessionCallback.

    SessionCallback<String> callback = new SessionCallback<String>() {
        @Override
        public <K, V> String execute(RedisOperations<K, V> operations) throws DataAccessException {
            operations.watch();
            // Read
            // May UNWATCH if updates are already done
            operations.multi();
            // Write operations
            operations.exec();
        }
    };

    redisTemplate.execute(callback);

Note, being consistent with the Redis' `exec()` command, `RedisOperations.exec()` returns `null` results when the execution is aborted due to watch violations.

Remember we are still doing optimistic locking here.  So, to make it truly ready for production work, wrap the above code into a retry loop with exponential backoffs:

    SessionCallback<String> callback = new SessionCallback<String>() {
        @Override
        public <K, V> String execute(RedisOperations<K, V> operations) throws DataAccessException {
            int retryLimit = 10;
            long delay = 10;
            List<Object> results = null;
            int i = 0;
            while (results == null && i < retryLimit) {
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(delay << i);
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    new RuntimeException(e);
                }
                operations.watch();
                // Read
                // May UNWATCH if updates are already done
                operations.multi();
                // Write operations
                results = operations.exec();
                i++;
            }
        }
    };

    redisTemplate.execute(callback);

### Distributed locks

Optimistic locking with retry is simple to implement and works well when race conditions rarely occur. However, the solution runs into problems when the load increases and the chance of race conditions increases with the load.  This is where distributed locks come to rescue. With Redis it is easy to implement distributed locks.

The Redis command is `SETNX key value` (set if not exist) which returns a boolean indicating if the key has been set. To acquire the lock, use `SETNX` to check if the ID of the distributed object has been set. If it has not been set yet, we will have set it and we will have acquired the lock. If it has already been set, some other remote process is working on it, we will either wait or will work on some other object. That is the basic idea of using `SETNX` for doing distributed locking.

But that is not enough. A process may acquire the lock and never release it (due to code error, runtime crash, etc). To avoid that, we must associate an expiration time with the lock so that, after a reasonable amount time, the lock expires and is removed by Redis. In fact, every call to acquire the lock has the duty to set the expire if it is not set yet.

Another potentially dangerous scenario is that a process, which is not the owner of the lock, releases the lock. To avoid that, we guard the lock with a UUID (universally unique identifier). At the time the lock is being acquired, we generate a UUID and set the lock's value to be the UUID. When the lock is being released, we ask for the UUID and verify that it is the owner that is releasing the lock.

To put it together, this is pseudo-code:

    // Returns a UUID if the lock is acquired
    // or null if the lock is not acquired
    acquire(lock: String): String
        Generate a uuid
        SETNX lock uuid
        If the lock is set
            Return uuid
        Else
            Set expire on the lock if it is not set
            Return null

    release(lock: String, uuid: String): boolean
        Get the uuid for the lock
        If the uuid matches
            Delete the lock
            Return TRUE
        Else
            Return FALSE
